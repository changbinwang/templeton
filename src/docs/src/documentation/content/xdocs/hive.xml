   <title>Results</title>
     <p>The Hive function runs your hive job and returns the JSON object:</p>
     <p><code> {"result": MESSAGE, "jobid": JOBID, "status": STATUS} </code></p>
     <p>Where MESSAGE is a string similar to "ok", JOBID is a 
        string containing the ID of your 
        job, and STATUS is a string containg the current job status, for example 
        "completed" or "running".</p>   
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> Your results are limited to 1MB.  In addition, your 
        Hive statement or program must store the results somewhere in HDFS for you
        to retrieve them.</p>
