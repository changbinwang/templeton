      <title>HCatalog </title>
      
       <p>HCatalog is a table management and storage management layer for Hadoop that enables users with different data processing tools – Pig, MapReduce, Hive, Streaming – to more easily read and write data on the grid. HCatalog’s table abstraction presents users with a relational view of data in the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and ensures that users need not worry about where or in what format their data is stored – RCFile format, text files, sequence files. </p>
<p>(Note: In this release, Streaming is not supported. Also, HCatalog supports only writing RCFile formatted files and only reading PigStorage formated text files.)</p>

      <title>HCatalog Architecture</title>
      <p>HCatalog is built on top of the Hive metastore and incorporates components from the Hive DDL. HCatalog provides read and write interfaces for Pig and MapReduce and a command line interface for data definitions.</p>
<p>(Note: HCatalog notification is not available in this release.)</p>

<title>Interfaces</title>   
<p>The HCatalog interface for Pig – HCatLoader and HCatStorer – is an implementation of the Pig load and store interfaces. HCatLoader accepts a table to read data from; you can indicate which partitions to scan by immediately following the load statement with a partition filter statement. HCatStorer accepts a table to write to and a specification of partition keys to create a new partition. Currently HCatStorer only supports writing to one partition. HCatLoader and HCatStorer are implemented on top of HCatInputFormat and HCatOutputFormat respectively (see <a href="loadstore.html">HCatalog Load and Store</a>).</p>

<p>The HCatalog interface for MapReduce – HCatInputFormat and HCatOutputFormat – is an implementation of Hadoop InputFormat and OutputFormat. HCatInputFormat accepts a table to read data from and a selection predicate to indicate which partitions to scan. HCatOutputFormat accepts a table to write to and a specification of partition keys to create a new partition. Currently HCatOutputFormat only supports writing to one partition (see <a href="inputoutput.html">HCatalog Input and Output</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently there is no Hive-specific interface. Since HCatalog uses Hive's metastore, Hive can read data in HCatalog directly as long as a SerDe for that data already exists. In the future we plan to write a HCatalogSerDe so that users won't need storage-specific SerDes and so that Hive users can write data to HCatalog. Currently, this is supported - if a Hive user writes data in the RCFile format, it is possible to read the data through HCatalog. Also, see <a href="supportedformats.html">Supported data formats</a>.</p>

<p>Data is defined using HCatalog's command line interface (CLI). The HCatalog CLI supports most of the DDL portion of Hive's query language, allowing users to create, alter, drop tables, etc. The CLI also supports the data exploration part of the Hive command line, such as SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE TABLE, etc. (see the <a href="cli.html">HCatalog Command Line Interface</a>).</p>

<title>Data Model</title>
<p>HCatalog presents a relational view of data in HDFS. Data is stored in tables and these tables can be placed in databases. Tables can also be hash partitioned on one or more keys; that is, for a given value of a key (or set of keys) there will be one partition that contains all rows with that value (or set of values). For example, if a table is partitioned on date and there are three days of data in the table, there will be three partitions in the table. New partitions can be added to a table, and partitions can be dropped from a table. Partitioned tables have no partitions at create time. Unpartitioned tables effectively have one default partition that must be created at table creation time. There is no guaranteed read consistency when a partition is dropped.</p>

<p>Partitions contain records. Once a partition is created records cannot be added to it, removed from it, or updated in it. (In the future some ability to integrate changes to a partition will be added.) Partitions are multi-dimensional and not hierarchical. Records are divided into columns. Columns have a name and a datatype. HCatalog supports the same datatypes as Hive (see <a href="loadstore.html">HCatalog Load and Store</a>). </p>

  <title>Data Flow Example</title>
  <p>This simple data flow example shows how HCatalog is used to move data from the grid into a database. 
  From the database, the data can then be analyzed using Hive.</p>
  
 <p><strong>First</strong> Joe in data acquisition uses distcp to get data onto the grid.</p>
 <source>
hadoop distcp file:///file.dat hdfs://data/rawevents/20100819/data

hcat "alter table rawevents add partition 20100819 hdfs://data/rawevents/20100819/data"
</source>
  
<p><strong>Second</strong> Sally in data processing uses Pig to cleanse and prepare the data.</p>  
<p>Without HCatalog, Sally must be manually informed by Joe that data is available, or use Oozie and poll on HDFS.</p>
<source>
A = load '/data/rawevents/20100819/data' as (alpha:int, beta:chararray, …);
B = filter A by bot_finder(zeta) = 0;
…
store Z into 'data/processedevents/20100819/data';
</source>

<p>With HCatalog, Oozie will be notified by HCatalog data is available and can then start the Pig job</p>
<source>
A = load 'rawevents' using HCatLoader;
B = filter A by date = '20100819' and by bot_finder(zeta) = 0;
…
store Z into 'processedevents' using HCatStorer("date=20100819");
</source>

<p><strong>Third</strong> Robert in client management uses Hive to analyze his clients' results.</p>
<p>Without HCatalog, Robert must alter the table to add the required partition. </p>
 <source>
alter table processedevents add partition 20100819 hdfs://data/processedevents/20100819/data

select advertiser_id, count(clicks)
from processedevents
where date = '20100819' 
group by adverstiser_id;
</source> 
<p>With HCatalog, Robert does not need to modify the table structure.</p>
 <source>
select advertiser_id, count(clicks)
from processedevents
where date = ‘20100819’ 
group by adverstiser_id;
</source>
