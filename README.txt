Templeton
=========

Templeton is a webapi on top of HCatalog and other Hadoop services.

Install
=======

Templeton is deep in the middle of development and doesn't have a
smooth install procedure.  As such, it should only be installed by expert
developers.

To install Templeton, read the installation section in the Templeton
manual.

Documentation
=============

templeton_docs.pdf is a pre-built, pdf version of the Templeton manual.

To build the Templeton documentation fresh from the source, run forrest in the 
src/docs directory.  This will create src/docs/build/site which will contain 
a complete html version of the Templeton documentation site. (Open index.html in 
your browser.)  In addition, src/docs/build/site/wholesite.pdf will be a fresh pdf 
version of the complete site in one file.
